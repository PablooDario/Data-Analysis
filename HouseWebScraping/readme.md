# Predicting House Prices in Mexico

##### This Folder has 2 files; both of them make Web Scrapping and Linear Regression for the house prices, but one is an automated program that uses selenium to perform web scraping on a website depending on the city that is in a txt.

## First Program (PricesPrediction)

 The first program reads the URL of the website that offeers houses in Mexico City, then does Web Scrapping to fetch all the data, does data cleaning, and finally does statistics calculus to obtain the linear regression and the predict.

## Second Program (AutomatizedPrediction)

 The second program does exactly the same as the first, but the difference is that at the beginning reads a txt file where you can put the city or counties, so the program makes a prediction in the mexican city you want, then uses Selenium to get the URL of the website with the offers of houses in that city. 

 **The other files are for the automatized program to run**
